# 🚀 IBM Data Science Capstone: SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

## 📚 Project Overview

Welcome to the IBM Data Science Capstone project! In this project, we will predict the **success of Falcon 9's first-stage landing**. SpaceX has revolutionized the space industry with reusable rockets, saving millions of dollars on each launch. Each Falcon 9 launch costs around **$62 million**, a significant saving compared to the **$165 million** for competitors. The key to these savings is the **reusability of the first stage** of the rocket.

### 🎯 Objective
Our goal is to predict whether the Falcon 9 **first stage will land successfully** after launch. If we can predict this reliably, we can estimate the **cost of a SpaceX launch** and offer valuable insights for competing companies who may bid for a launch against SpaceX. 💸

## 🛠️ Data Collection & Preprocessing

### 📡 Data Source
The data comes from a public API that provides details about **Falcon 9 rocket launches**. We will collect and process this data to ensure it is in the correct format for our prediction model.

### 🔄 Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Extract relevant features for the model.
- Handle missing or inconsistent data.
- Ensure that the data is structured correctly for machine learning algorithms.

## 📈 Model Development

Using the cleaned data, we will develop a machine learning model that will predict whether the first stage of Falcon 9 lands successfully. The model will be trained using historical launch data, which includes information about launch conditions, rocket configurations, and success or failure of previous landings.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- If we can predict whether the first stage will land, we can better understand how **launch costs** are affected by reusability.
- SpaceX could further optimize its **launch plans** and predict its reusability rate more accurately.
- This model can serve as a **benchmark for competition**, helping other companies determine if they can match or beat SpaceX's costs and reusability.

## 🚀 Example of a Successful Launch

A successful launch example might look like this:

- **Launch Success**: ✅
- **Landing Success**: ✅
- **Launch Number**: #72
- **Rocket Type**: Falcon 9 Full Thrust
- **Rocket Status**: Landed

The goal is to use similar historical data points to train our model and predict future outcomes. 🌟

## 🚀 Why This Project is Important

This project is not only about making predictions, but it can potentially **shape the future of space exploration and commercial spaceflight**. With more companies entering the space race, having predictive capabilities about cost-effective launches is key to staying competitive. 🌍
